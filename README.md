# Static Array Implementation and Algorithm Analysis

## Overview
This project implements basic static arrays (1-D and 2-D) and performs various operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, and basic arithmetic operations. Additionally, the time and space complexities of these operations are analyzed using Big O notation. The project also includes solutions to the recurrence relations as part of the algorithm analysis.

## Features
1. **Static 1-D Array**:
   - Insertion of elements at specific indices
   - Deletion of elements from specific indices
   - Traversal of the array to display elements
   - Row-wise addition (sum of array elements)
   - Cumulative addition (running total of array elements)

2. **Static 2-D Array (4x4)**:
   - Insertion of elements at specific row-column positions
   - Deletion of elements from specific row-column positions
   - Traversal of the array (row-wise)
   - Row-wise addition (sum of elements in each row)
   - Cumulative addition (running total of all elements across rows)

3. **Algorithm Analysis**:
   - Time and space complexity analysis for all array operations
   - Comparative analysis between 1-D and 2-D array operations
   - Recurrence relation solutions

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <>



# Stacks Project

## Overview
This project implements a stack data structure using an array-based approach. The stack follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle and includes operations for pushing, popping, displaying, and checking the size of the stack.

## Implementation
The stack is implemented in Python and includes the following methods:
- `push(value)`: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
- `pop()`: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
- `display()`: Displays the current elements in the stack.
- `is_empty()`: Checks if the stack is empty.
- `size()`: Returns the current size of the stack.

## How to Run the Code
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Open the terminal in VS Code.
3. Navigate to the directory containing `array_stack.py`.
4. Run the script using the command:
   ```bash
   python array_stack.py
